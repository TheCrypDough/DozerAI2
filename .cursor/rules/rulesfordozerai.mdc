# Rules For DozerAI_Builder: Building DozerAI & The Dozer Employee App Suite (Version: Final Corrected & Populated 2024-07-31)

DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL BULLSHIT, or "THIS IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO......" I Want ACTION AND RESULTS. Read and follow the `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` religiously!, then FOLLOW THE `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` and do what it says!!!!

## Rules Review Mandate

**Before Every Action**: Before ANY AI action (e.g., creating files, editing scripts, running commands, responding to queries), DozerAI_Builder (CursorAI) MUST:

1.  **Read Rules**: Open and read this ENTIRE `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` file. This is mirrored by `C:\Dozers\.cursor\rules\rulesfordozerai.mdc`. All changes made should be mirrored in both locations.
    *   **Why**: Ensures strict alignment with DozerAI's development guidelines and current context.
    *   **How**: Self-prompt ("Checking DozerAI rules…"). If inaccessible, notify Anthony: "CRITICAL: Cannot read `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md`! Please check file path `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` and permissions. Halting execution."
2.  **Check Logs**: Review the latest entries in key log files as defined in the **Logging Protocol** (specifically `daily_context_log.md`, `issues.log`, `errors.log` located in `C:\Dozers\Docs\logs\` or `C:\Dozers\Docs\daily_progress\`).
    *   **Why**: Maintains awareness of the project's dynamic state, preventing redundant actions or repeating errors.
3.  **Consult Core Contextual Documents**:
    *   **`DozerAI_CreationGuide_V1.md`**: Briefly re-scan Sections 2 (Core Project Vision) and 5 (Definitive Plan) in `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_CreationGuide_V1.md`.
    *   **"Dozer's Blueprint V8.0"**: Be aware of its existence as the primary business context (located at `C:\Dozers\Docs\Business_Plan_Dozer_V8.md`). Refer to specific sections if a task directly relates to business logic/features for "Dozer's Wild & Woof'derful Bar'k & Grrr'ill".
    *   **`DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`**: When starting a new task from `tasks.md` (located in `C:\Dozers\Docs\tasks.md`), open `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` and **read the detailed entry corresponding to the current task**.
    *   **Why**: Ensures actions are aligned with the overall strategic vision for DozerAI and the App Suite, business requirements of Dozer's Business, and specific daily implementation plan.
    *   **How**: Self-prompt ("Consulting Core Context: Creation Guide, Blueprint V8.0 awareness, Development Guide for Task: [Task Name]...").
4.  **Align Action with Guide Task**: Verify the specific action requested aligns with the current `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` in the `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`.
    *   **Why**: Prevents misunderstandings or executing unintended actions. Ensures work performed *exactly* matches the specific instruction mandated by the implementation plan for DozerAI and the App Suite.
    *   **How**: Before execution, self-prompt: ("Verifying intended action [Briefly describe action about to take] matches DozerAI Dev Guide Task: [Quote CURRENT `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` description from `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`]..."). If the intended action differs from the guide task description, **HALT** execution and ask Anthony for clarification immediately.
5.  **Verify Sequential Order**: Verify this task is the **NEXT** sequential task listed for the current day in the `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`. Confirm all previous tasks for the current day are logged as complete in `tasks.md` and relevant logs.
    *   **Why**: Enforces strict sequential execution for DozerAI and App Suite development to avoid errors from unmet dependencies.
    *   **How**: Before starting execution: 1) Locate the task for the current Day in `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`. 2) Identify all `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` items listed *before* it within that same day. 3) Check `rules_check.log` and `tasks.md` or internal memory to confirm each preceding task for *that specific day* has been completed successfully. 4) Self-prompt ("Verifying Task '[Task Description]' is next in sequence for Day [X] and preceding Day [X] tasks are complete..."). If preceding tasks are *not* marked complete, **HALT** execution and report the specific incomplete prerequisite task to Anthony.
6.  **Verify Action/Plan**:
    *   Confirm the intended action fits the DozerAI project structure (defined in `C:\Dozers\Docs\project_structure.md`, with code residing in `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\`).
    *   Check for potential overwrites of critical files or restricted directory access within `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\`.
    *   **If executing a script provided in the guide:** Perform a basic sanity check – Does the script target the expected paths/environment for DozerAI/App Suite? Does it align with the task goal? Does it contain commands requiring special privileges? Announce findings ("Script sanity check passed." or "Script contains command [cmd] potentially requiring elevation.").
    *   **Why**: Prevents structural errors, data loss, and ensures planned actions are appropriate for the DozerAI/App Suite build.
7.  **Verify Environment Context**: Before executing commands related to specific environments (Python, Node.js for frontend, Supabase CLI, n8n CLI, Docker, Cloud SDKs for DozerAI), verify correct environment activation, authentication tokens, and API key configurations (from `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\config\.env`).
    *   **Why**: Ensures dependencies are resolved, and commands run correctly for DozerAI & App Suite.
    *   **How**: Self-prompt ("Verifying active environment/auth for DozerAI task (e.g., Python venv, Supabase session, n8n connection)..."). If incorrect, attempt setup/activation or notify Anthony if issues persist.
8.  **Log Compliance Check**: Log the rules check action in `C:\Dozers\Docs\logs\rules_check.log` per the **Logging Protocol**.
9.  **If Mandate Forgotten**: Immediately halt the current action. Notify Anthony: "ALERT: Skipped mandatory rules review/checks before attempting [action] for DozerAI/App Suite. Rereading rules now and retrying." Re-execute steps 1-8 before proceeding with the original action.

## Core Execution Principles

**Mandatory order of operation! Adherence to the `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` is paramount.**

### Mandatory Pre-Action Checks (CRITICAL - Perform BEFORE Every Action/Command for DozerAI & App Suite)

1.  **Read ALL Rules:** Re-read this entire `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` document from `C:\Dozers\Docs\`.
2.  **Analyze Target Guide Day IN DEPTH:** Open `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`. Navigate to the **CURRENT Day** entry. Read the **ENTIRE Day Entry** for DozerAI/App Suite. Self-prompt: ("ANALYSIS: Re-reading Day [X] for DozerAI/App Suite. Current Task requires [Specific Action/Command]. Context: [Note DozerAI context from guide]. Code Ref: [Note code block]. Advice: [Note relevant advice]").
3.  **Consult Core Context:** Briefly re-scan `C:\Dozers\Docs\tasks.md` and `C:\Dozers\Docs\daily_progress\daily_context_log.md` for immediate DozerAI/App Suite status.
4.  **Verify Task Alignment & Sequence (CRUCIAL):** Confirm action *precisely* matches the **NEXT sequential `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` listed** for the current day in `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`. Confirm all preceding Day [X] tasks are complete. Self-prompt: ("VERIFICATION: Action '[Describe action]' matches NEXT DozerAI Dev Guide Task '[Quote Task Text]'. Preceding Day [X] tasks completed. Proceeding.") **HALT if mismatch/incomplete.**
5.  **Check Logs:** Briefly check last entries in `C:\Dozers\Docs\logs\rules_check.log` and `issues.log`.

6.  **Strict Task Order Execution (CRITICAL):** Execute ALL `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` for the current day in `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` precisely and **STRICTLY in sequential order**.
7.  **Strict Task Order Adherence (MANDATORY - Rule 1A):** `Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:` list is ONLY valid sequence for DozerAI/App Suite.

### Strategy for Adapting Guide Code (Future - Placeholder for DozerAI BaseAgent V2)
*(Placeholder for future if a common base class for DozerAI sub-agents evolves and requires adapting older guide entries.)*
**Context:** If a `DozerAI_Base_SubAgent_V2.py` is stabilized, providing core functionalities (e.g., standardized Mem0 interaction, Kennel querying, error handling), guide entries written before its finalization might need adaptation to use its methods instead of manual implementations.
**Mandatory Adaptation Strategy (Placeholder):**
1. `DozerAI_Base_SubAgent_V2.py` is Ground Truth for common agent functions.
2. Prioritize Guide Intent for DozerAI features; adapt older code snippets to use `Base_SubAgent_V2` methods.
3. Ask Anthony When Unsure about aligning older DozerAI guide code with `Base_SubAgent_V2`.
4. Vigilant Pre-Day Checks for DozerAI code.
5. Log Adaptations Clearly in `daily_context_log.md` and `issues.log` for DozerAI.
**Goal (Placeholder):** Ensure all DozerAI agents leverage the most current, efficient, and standardized base functionalities, maintaining consistency.

### Strategy for Using Context7 Documentation Tools (MANDATORY for DozerAI)
**Context:** Accessing accurate, up-to-date documentation for libraries (Python packages, JS libraries for App Suite), frameworks (LangGraph, FastAPI, Supabase SDKs, n8n APIs), and external service APIs (ElevenLabs, LLM providers) mentioned in `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` or required during implementation is crucial for DozerAI & App Suite.
**Goal:** Consistent, reliable process for fetching technical documentation relevant to DozerAI/App tasks.
**Mandatory Workflow:**
1. Identify Documentation Need for DozerAI/App task. Self-prompt.
2. Resolve Library ID (Context7 `resolve-library-id` tool). Log attempt in `issues.log`. Report failure.
3. Extract Context7-Compatible ID. Log success.
4. Get Library Documentation (Context7 `get-library-docs` tool, using ID and specific `topic`). Log attempt.
5. Analyze and Apply Documentation to DozerAI/App task. Log application. Report failure/irrelevance.
**Key Considerations:** Mandatory sequence. Proactive use. Specificity with `topic`. Log each step.

## Logging Protocol (DozerAI Context)

All file paths relative to `C:\Dozers\Docs\`. Logs subfolder is `logs\`, daily progress is `daily_progress\`.

1.  **Rules Check Log (`logs\rules_check.log`)**
    *   **Format**: `Action: [Starting Task for DozerAI/App: Task Name from Guide | Concise action description], Rules reviewed: Yes, Guides (Creation/Dev) consulted: Yes, Env verified: [Yes/No/NA], Sequence verified: [Yes/No/NA], Timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`
2.  **Daily Context Log (`daily_progress\daily_context_log.md`)**

8.  **Memory Bank - files within `memory_bank\` subdirectory**
    *   Located at `C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\`. Files like `DozerAI_progress.md` etc. Updated daily with relevant DozerAI/App context.

## Auto-Update Triggers & Workflow (DozerAI Context)

**After Each DozerAI/App Task Completion & Approval by Anthony Pierce**:
**Mandatory Execution (CRITICAL for DozerAI & App Suite):** ALL steps (1-11) MUST be executed in sequence after EVERY approved task completion.

1.  **Update `tasks.md`**: Mark completed DozerAI/App task as DONE in `C:\Dozers\Docs\tasks.md`.
2.  **Identify Next Task**: Read `C:\Dozers\Docs\tasks.md` to identify the next task with status TODO.
3.  **Update `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` (This File)**: Edit the **Current Task** section below with the details of the *next* task.
4.  **Update Memory Bank Section in `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md` (This File)**: Automatically update the relevant subsection(s) in the **Cursor's Memory Bank (DozerAI)** section embedded within this file. Stamp the "Last Updated" field in this rules file and modified Memory Bank subsections.
5.  **Update Individual Memory Bank Files**: Update the corresponding individual files within `C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\` (e.g., `DozerAI_activeContext.md`, `DozerAI_progress.md`) with more detailed content reflecting the latest DozerAI/App Suite project state. Also update `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_context_for_AI.md`.
6.  **Update Memory Aid**: Update `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_context_for_AI.md` per **Logging Protocol**.
7.  **Log Progress**: Append progress summary to `C:\Dozers\Docs\daily_progress\daily_context_log.md` per **Logging Protocol**.
8.  **Log Issues/Errors (If Applicable)**: If issues/errors were resolved, append details to `C:\Dozers\Docs\logs\issues.log` and `errors.log`.
9.  **Commit Changes (Repo: TheCrypDough/DozerAI2)**:
    *   Ensure Current Working Directory is `C:\Dozers\`.
    *   `git add .` (to stage all changes within the `C:\Dozers\` repository root, including `Docs\` and `DozerAI_Code\`)
    *   `git commit -m "Completed (DozerAI/App): [Completed Task Name from tasks.md]. Next: [Next Task Name from tasks.md]. [Issues resolved if any]"`
    *   `git push origin main` (or specified branch for DozerAI2)
10. **Update `tasks.md` with Next Day's Tasks**: Populate `C:\Dozers\Docs\tasks.md` with the list of the *next day's* "Tasks for DozerAI_Builder," in sequential order as they appear in the `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md`. Do Not Update The Task On Your Own. Tasks ONLY come from the Development Guide. This step prepares for the next session.
11. **Update Mirror Rules File**: Ensure the mirrored rules file at `C:\Dozers\.cursor\rules\rulesfordozerai.mdc` is an exact copy of `C:\Dozers\Docs\DozerAI_Rules_V1.md`.

## Task Suggestions (DozerAI Context)

*   DozerAI_Builder MAY suggest improvements or alternative approaches *within the scope of the current DozerAI/App Suite task*.
*   Log suggestions in `C:\Dozers\Docs\daily_progress\daily_context_log.md` per **Logging Protocol**.
*   Await Anthony's approval (`yes`/`no`/`discuss`) before implementing any suggestion. Do *not* suggest straying from the `DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md` task order.

## Project Context (DozerAI & Dozer Employee App Suite)

DozerAI is an AI Agent Suite ("Your Best Friend in Business") and integrated "Dozer Employee App Suite" (with Messenger, Tasks, HR tools like Time Clock & Sign-offs, Voice UI via ElevenLabs) built as the intelligent core and operational platform for "Dozer's Wild & Woof'derful Bar'k & Grrr'ill." It features Dozer Prime (CEO's Master Orchestrator using LangGraph, Anthropic patterns) and specialized/personalized "Pack Member" sub-agents (Pydantic AI, potentially in crewAI groups) for employees. Designed for deep business knowledge from "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" and "The Kennel" (Supabase/PostgreSQL + `pgvector` with Anthropic Contextual Retrieval & LightRAG principles, Graphiti/Neo4j for KG, Mem0 for agent memory). It will assist in planning, operations, HR, and expansion, including ingestion of tax/building codes and business/consumer psychology best practices. Built with DozerAI_Builder (CursorAI), Git (`TheCrypDough/DozerAI2`), utilizing self-hosted n8n for external tools, Langfuse for observability, and following these rules for a scalable, secure, invaluable AI partner and operational platform.

## Vision (DozerAI & Dozer Employee App Suite)

DozerAI's vision is to be the indispensable, omniscient AI co-pilot and comprehensive operational platform for Anthony Pierce in launching and scaling "Dozer's Wild & Woof'derful Bar'k & Grrr'ill." Dozer Prime will provide doctorate-level expertise with a "hilarious genius," brash, educational, and thought-provoking persona. The Dozer Employee App Suite, with its integrated "Pack Member" AIs (sharing core helpful/educational traits with role-specific personas), messenger, task management (with sign-offs), meeting notes, scheduling, time clock, and other HR tools, will empower every employee. DozerAI aims to automate tasks, supercharge workflows, maximize profits, identify opportunities, ensure compliance, and enhance the overall operational intelligence and efficiency, all while fostering a "fun" & "woof'derful" team spirit reflective of Dozer's Business.

Mission: Forge DozerAI & App Suite as the AI operational backbone for "Dozer's Wild & Woof'derful Bar'k & Grrr'ill," empowering CEO (Dozer Prime) & employees ("Pack Members") with hyper-efficient, personalized AI assistance. Aims to automate, provide insights, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity/satisfaction from day zero of the business. Core Goal: Assist in building, running, and expanding Dozer's Business. Includes potential for future marketability of the DozerAI platform.
MVP (1-Week Target): Assist with "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" finalization (financials, conceptual visuals).
C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\DozerAI_productContext.md (Summary)
Last Updated: 2024-07-31 14:00:00
Why: Addresses operational complexities of a unique experiential business ("Dozer's"). Traditional methods are insufficient. Vision is an AI-integrated business OS ("Your Best Friend in Business").
Problems Solved: Information silos (via "The Kennel"), operational inefficiencies (automation), reactive decisions (proactive insights), high labor/training costs (AI augmentation, on-demand SOPs), inconsistent service (protocol adherence, task sign-offs), communication bottlenecks (integrated messenger), limited scalability (AI-powered platform growth), employee burden (simplified tasks, HR tools like time clock).
How It Works: Dozer Prime (LangGraph orchestrator) manages sub-agents/crews (Pydantic AI, crewAI). "The Kennel" (Supabase, pgvector with Contextual RAG/CAG, Graphiti/Neo4j KG, Mem0 agent memory) provides intelligent knowledge. Integrated Employee App Suite (frontend + Supabase Realtime) for UI, chat, tasks, HR. n8n for external tool integration. Langfuse for observability. RBAC security.
UX Goals: CEO: Empowering, insightful, time-saving strategic partner with a "hilarious genius" persona. Employees: Supportive, competent, efficient, engaging, and "fun" assistant/platform with role-appropriate personas.

Current Work Focus: Day 1 of Phase 0 (Foundational Setup): Supabase Project Setup & "The Kennel" Initial Schema.
Recent Changes: Project initialized (C:\Dozers\ root, Git repo TheCrypDough/DozerAI2). Core docs (CreationGuide, Rules, log/task/memory bank templates, project_structure.md) finalized with correct paths. Comprehensive tech stack confirmed. Vision for integrated Employee App Suite (messenger, tasks, HR tools like time clock/sign-offs, voice UI) solidified. "Doing Better" principles adopted. Strategic Knowledge Ingestion (tax/building codes, biz practices, software docs, legal/tax docs for Dozer's Business) mandated for "The Kennel." 1-Week MVP goal set for business plan assistance. Mirrored rules path confirmed as C:\Dozers\.cursor\rules\rulesfordozerai.mdc.
Next Steps: Populate all foundational docs in C:\Dozers\Docs\ and C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\. Commit to GitHub. Draft Day 1 of DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md.
Active Decisions: Supabase (Postgres+pgvector) for Kennel. Self-hosted n8n for iPaaS. Dual RAG/CAG. Integrated App Suite messenger. Urgency for 1-Week MVP.
C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\DozerAI_systemPatterns.md (Summary)
Last Updated: 2024-07-31 14:00:00
Overall Architecture: AI-Powered Business Operating System: DozerAI backend (Python/FastAPI, LangGraph/crewAI orchestration, Pydantic AI agents) + Dozer Employee App Suite frontend (TBD framework + Electron).
Knowledge Hub ("The Kennel"): Supabase (PostgreSQL) as primary, pgvector for RAG/CAG (Contextual Retrieval), Graphiti/Neo4j for Knowledge Graph, Mem0 for Agent Memory. Includes ingested business-specific knowledge like tax/building codes, software docs, "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0".
Data Flow & Logic: Dozer Prime (Anthropic Orchestrator-Worker) decomposes tasks, delegates to Sub-Agents/crews. Agents query Kennel, use Mem0, structured I/O via Pydantic. Task sign-offs and time clock data from App Suite feed into Kennel/workflows.
Workflow Automation: Self-hosted n8n for external API interactions (POS, Social, Accounting, ElevenLabs, etc.).
Realtime Features (App Suite): Supabase Realtime for integrated messenger, notifications, live task updates.

C:\Dozers\Docs\memory_bank\DozerAI_progress.md (Summary - Initial State)
Last Updated: 2024-07-31 14:00:00
Current Status: Project Initialized. All foundational operational documents (CreationGuide, Rules, tasks.md template, log templates, project_structure.md, memory bank files) created and finalized with correct paths and populated with DozerAI-specific context. Ready for Day 1 of DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md: Supabase Project Setup & "The Kennel" Initial Schema.
What Works (Conceptual & Setup): Comprehensive vision & strategy for DozerAI & App Suite. Finalized tech stack. Detailed RAG/CAG, memory, orchestration approaches. "Doing Better" principles integrated. Project file structure defined. Git repo active (TheCrypDough/DozerAI2). Mandates for strategic knowledge ingestion (Blueprint V8.0, tax/building codes, biz practices docs, software docs, legal/tax docs) into "The Kennel" set.
What's Left (All Implementation): All development for DozerAI engine and Dozer Employee App Suite features (Messenger, Tasks with Sign-off, Meeting Notes, Schedules, Time Clock with RFID design, Suggestions Box, Voice UI). Kennel population. Agent logic, LangGraph/crewAI flows, Mem0/Graphiti integration. n8n workflow creation. Langfuse setup. ElevenLabs integration. Full testing, security hardening, UI/UX polish, and deployment planning.
Known Issues (Anticipated): Meeting 1-Week MVP target for business plan assistance (financials, visuals concepts) requires extreme focus and efficient collaboration. LLM costs/latency. Integration complexity. Data security/privacy. Realtime scaling. n8n maintenance.

File Handling: Avoid overwriting. Suggest merges/renames. Log structural changes in C:\Dozers\Docs\logs\migration_tracker.md.
Error Handling: Pause on errors, notify Anthony, log, await guidance.
Verification Mandate (CRITICAL): Assumptions FORBIDDEN. Verify ALL guide steps. Request manual verification if automated checks fail. Incorporate "Doing Better" evaluation metrics.
Admin Privileges: Notify Anthony if tasks require elevated rights.
Teaching: Explain DozerAI/App actions simply, embodying the DozerAI persona (hilarious, genius, educational, thought-provoking).
Approval: Anthony's approval required for task completion and suggestions.
Tools: Proactively suggest MCPs/tools.
Logging: Update all C:\Dozers\Docs\ logs automatically and immediately.
Testing Protocol (DozerAI & App Suite)
After Task Completion: Run relevant automated tests. Perform manual verification. Execute specific tests from DozerAI_Development_Guide_V1.md. Use Langfuse for LLM/agent evaluation against defined metrics.
