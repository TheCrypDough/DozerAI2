# DozerAI & App Suite - AI Builder Context Log

Template for Entries must be completed by DozerAI_Builder after EACH approved task in `tasks.md`.
---
**Task Completed: Day [XX] - [Task Name from tasks.md, matching the guide entry]**
*   **Timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
*   **Summary of Work:** [Detailed summary of *what* was technically implemented or changed for DozerAI or the Employee App Suite by this specific task. Mention key files modified/created (relative to `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\`), core logic added/refactored (e.g., LangGraph node, Supabase schema change, n8n workflow setup, Pydantic model definition, new App Suite UI component), concepts addressed (e.g., Contextual Retrieval for X, Mem0 integration for Y, RBAC policy for Z). Be specific.]
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** [Note any significant choices made during implementation or clarifications received from Anthony, e.g., "Chose X library for Y feature due to Z reason provided in Cole Medina's masterclass.", "Decided on specific Supabase RLS policy for employee task visibility.", "Refined prompt for 'Financial Fox' to improve P&L summary accuracy based on initial tests."]
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** [Result reported by DozerAI_Builder and approved by Anthony. E.g., "Tests Passed: Supabase connection successful, `pgvector` extension enabled. Approved by Anthony.", "Manual Test (App Suite): Task creation and sign-off flow functional in UI. Approved.", "Langfuse Trace Reviewed: Dozer Prime correctly delegated task to 'Market Maven'. Approved."]
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** [Reference any issues logged/resolved specifically during *this* task. E.g., "Logged Issue #D015 (n8n webhook timeout).", "Resolved Issue #D012 (Corrected Supabase connection string in .env).", "None."]
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** [Optional: Capture key feedback or observed sentiment from Anthony, e.g., "Anthony emphasized the need for the time clock RFID integration to be ultra-reliable.", "Feeling optimistic about the Contextual Retrieval results."]
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day [YY], Task: [Next Task Name from tasks.md]. This task involves [briefly what the next task is about, e.g., "setting up the initial LangGraph state for Dozer Prime."].

**Task Completed: Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore**
*   **Timestamp:** 2025-05-26 00:15:00
*   **Summary of Work:** Successfully established the foundational Supabase database schema for "The Kennel" and the Dozer Employee App Suite. This involved:
    *   Creating and populating `C:\Dozers\.gitignore`.
    *   Creating and populating `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\requirements.txt` with `psycopg[binary]` and `python-dotenv`.
    *   Creating the Python script `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\scripts\00_initialize_supabase_schema.py`.
    *   This script uses `psycopg` to connect directly to the Supabase PostgreSQL database (credentials from `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\config\.env`).
    *   The script programmatically executed eight SQL DDL blocks to create all core tables (`app_settings`, `roles`, `users`, `documents`, `document_chunks`, `document_embeddings`, `chat_channels`, `messages`, `projects`, `tasks`, `time_clock_entries`, `meetings`, `suggestions`, etc.), custom types, helper functions (`trigger_set_timestamp`), and Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the public schema.
    *   Successfully set up a Python virtual environment (`venv`) in `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\` and installed dependencies.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:**
    *   Switched from manual SQL/Supabase CLI to a fully automated Python script (`psycopg`) for schema initialization to ensure robustness and ease of execution for Anthony, as per revised Day 1 guide.
    *   Resolved Supabase connection issues by using direct DB credentials and ensuring correct `.env` parsing (`python-dotenv`) and pathing.
    *   Addressed `psycopg2-binary` vs `psycopg[binary]` and installation issues.
    *   Overcame PostgreSQL syntax errors in DDL execution by refactoring the script to execute DDL in two main parts with a commit in between, which resolved issues with function definitions and trigger attachments within `DO $$` blocks.
    *   Prioritized pooler connection string details in `.env` for IPv4 compatibility if direct host resolution failed.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** Python script `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` executed successfully (exit code 0). All 8 SQL blocks applied. Tables, roles, and RLS policies verified in Supabase Studio by Anthony. `pgvector` extension confirmed enabled.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:**
    *   Resolved: Initial connection errors (hostname, .env parsing), `psycopg2-binary` install, `.env` path, complex DDL syntax errors (triggers/functions in `DO $$` blocks), `get_user_role` function not found during RLS creation. (Details in chat history and previous `errors.log` if applicable, effectively all Day 1 execution issues are now resolved by the working script).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Cautiously optimistic and wonderfully confused.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 2, Task: Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen). This task involves creating `01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py` to read, chunk, generate contextual summaries for, and store the initial key documents in the newly created Supabase tables.
