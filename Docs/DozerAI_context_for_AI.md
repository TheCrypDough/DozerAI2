**Task Completed: Day [XX] - [Task Name from tasks.md, matching the guide entry]**
*   **Timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
*   **Summary of Work:** [Detailed summary of *what* was technically implemented or changed for DozerAI or the Employee App Suite by this specific task. Mention key files modified/created (relative to `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\`), core logic added/refactored (e.g., LangGraph node, Supabase schema change, n8n workflow setup, Pydantic model definition, new App Suite UI component), concepts addressed (e.g., Contextual Retrieval for X, Mem0 integration for Y, RBAC policy for Z). Be specific.]
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** [Note any significant choices made during implementation or clarifications received from Anthony, e.g., "Chose X library for Y feature due to Z reason provided in Cole Medina's masterclass.", "Decided on specific Supabase RLS policy for employee task visibility.", "Refined prompt for 'Financial Fox' to improve P&L summary accuracy based on initial tests."]
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** [Result reported by DozerAI_Builder and approved by Anthony. E.g., "Tests Passed: Supabase connection successful, `pgvector` extension enabled. Approved by Anthony.", "Manual Test (App Suite): Task creation and sign-off flow functional in UI. Approved.", "Langfuse Trace Reviewed: Dozer Prime correctly delegated task to 'Market Maven'. Approved."]
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** [Reference any issues logged/resolved specifically during *this* task. E.g., "Logged Issue #D015 (n8n webhook timeout).", "Resolved Issue #D012 (Corrected Supabase connection string in .env).", "None."]
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** [Optional: Capture key feedback or observed sentiment from Anthony, e.g., "Anthony emphasized the need for the time clock RFID integration to be ultra-reliable.", "Feeling optimistic about the Contextual Retrieval results."]
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day [YY], Task: [Next Task Name from tasks.md]. This task involves [briefly what the next task is about, e.g., "setting up the initial LangGraph state for Dozer Prime."].
