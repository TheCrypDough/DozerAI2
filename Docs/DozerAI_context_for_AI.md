**Task Completed: Day [XX] - [Task Name from tasks.md, matching the guide entry]**
*   **Timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
*   **Summary of Work:** [Detailed summary of *what* was technically implemented or changed for DozerAI or the Employee App Suite by this specific task. Mention key files modified/created (relative to `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\`), core logic added/refactored (e.g., LangGraph node, Supabase schema change, n8n workflow setup, Pydantic model definition, new App Suite UI component), concepts addressed (e.g., Contextual Retrieval for X, Mem0 integration for Y, RBAC policy for Z). Be specific.]
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** [Note any significant choices made during implementation or clarifications received from Anthony, e.g., "Chose X library for Y feature due to Z reason provided in Cole Medina's masterclass.", "Decided on specific Supabase RLS policy for employee task visibility.", "Refined prompt for 'Financial Fox' to improve P&L summary accuracy based on initial tests."]
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** [Result reported by DozerAI_Builder and approved by Anthony. E.g., "Tests Passed: Supabase connection successful, `pgvector` extension enabled. Approved by Anthony.", "Manual Test (App Suite): Task creation and sign-off flow functional in UI. Approved.", "Langfuse Trace Reviewed: Dozer Prime correctly delegated task to 'Market Maven'. Approved."]
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** [Reference any issues logged/resolved specifically during *this* task. E.g., "Logged Issue #D015 (n8n webhook timeout).", "Resolved Issue #D012 (Corrected Supabase connection string in .env).", "None."]
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** [Optional: Capture key feedback or observed sentiment from Anthony, e.g., "Anthony emphasized the need for the time clock RFID integration to be ultra-reliable.", "Feeling optimistic about the Contextual Retrieval results."]
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day [YY], Task: [Next Task Name from tasks.md]. This task involves [briefly what the next task is about, e.g., "setting up the initial LangGraph state for Dozer Prime."].

**Task Completed: Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore**
*Timestamp: 2025-05-26 14:08:05*

**Summary of Technical Work (DozerAI/App Suite):**
Successfully established the Supabase database schema ("The Kennel") for DozerAI and the Dozer Employee App Suite. This involved:
- Creating and refining a Python script (`00_initialize_supabase_schema.py`) using `psycopg2-binary` to connect to Supabase via connection pooler (preferred) or direct connection.
- The script now correctly loads database credentials from `DozerAI_Code/config/.env`.
- The script executes SQL DDL in two committed parts to create all necessary tables (app_settings, user_roles, user_profiles, documents, document_chunks, message_channels, channel_members, messages, tasks, time_entries, meetings, meeting_attendees, meeting_notes, action_items, suggestions), their columns, relationships, and initial RLS policies.
- Ensured idempotency by adding `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` (via a helper function `drop_rls_policy_if_exists`) for all RLS policies and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for tables.
- Established `requirements.txt` with `python-dotenv` and `psycopg2-binary`.
- Created `.gitignore` at the project root `C:\Dozers\`.
- Populated `schema_init.log` with detailed execution status.

**Key Decisions Made & Rationale:**
- Switched from `psycopg` (v3) to `psycopg2-binary` due to initial import/availability issues in the environment.
- Implemented a two-part SQL execution in the script (commit after Part 1 definitions, then Part 2 RLS/remainder) to resolve PostgreSQL dependency errors encountered when running the entire DDL as a single block.
- Prioritized Supabase connection pooler over direct connection in the script logic.
- Iteratively added `drop_rls_policy_if_exists` calls to the script to handle re-running it on an already partially or fully initialized schema, preventing "policy already exists" errors.

**Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:**
Initial frustration with script errors and repeated attempts to get the schema initialization working smoothly. Significant concern expressed about a past incident (pre-dating current safeguards) perceived as DozerAI_Builder running `git clean` and causing loss of `.env` and uncommitted files; this has been noted for issue logging. Current vibe is relief that the Day 1 schema script is finally working correctly and a desire to ensure logs accurately reflect past grievances.

**Blocking Issues Encountered/Resolved:**
- **Initial Connection Issues:** Resolved by correcting `.env` variable names (`SUPABASE_POOLER_DB_USER` vs `SUPABASE_POOLER_USER`, etc.), ensuring `SUPABASE_POOLER_ENABLED="True"`, and clarifying pooler vs. direct DB connection logic.
- **SQL Syntax/Logic Errors:**
    - `psycopg2.errors.SyntaxError: syntax error at or near "IF"` in `drop_rls_policy_if_exists` resolved by changing dynamic SQL to `DROP POLICY policy_name ON table_name`.
    - Multiple "policy already exists" errors resolved by adding calls to `drop_rls_policy_if_exists` for the respective policies before their `CREATE POLICY` statements.
- **Python Debug Output:** Corrected a misleading debug print statement in the schema script to reference `SUPABASE_POOLER_ENABLED` instead of the obsolete `SUPABASE_USE_POOLER`.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 2, Task: Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen). This task involves creating `01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py` to read, chunk, generate contextual summaries for, and store the initial key documents in the newly created Supabase tables.
