2. Core Project Vision (Current Alignment - Summary)
Application: DozerAI - An AI Agent Suite featuring "Dozer Prime" (CEO's Master Orchestrator) and "Pack Member" agents (role-specific, personalized employee assistants). Integrated with and accessible via the "Dozer Employee App Suite" (Web/Electron Desktop & Mobile PWA/Native) which includes team messaging, task management (with sign-offs), meeting tools (notes, transcripts, audio), HR functions (time clock with RFID/app options, time-off requests, suggestions box), and voice interaction (ElevenLabs).
    Quality Focus: Doctorate-level business expertise, Ivy League-level assistance. Uncompromising reliability, security (RBAC via Supabase RLS), maintainability, accuracy, and an intuitive, "fun" & "stunning" UX. Emphasis on "Doing Better" principles: rigorous evaluation (Langfuse + custom metrics), security depth (threat modeling), cost optimization (LLM choice, prompt caching), scalability (load testing).
    Target Users: Anthony Pierce (CEO - Dozer Prime with "hilarious genius" persona, full access). All future employees of Dozer's Business (Pack Member agents tailored to their specific roles, supportive personas, scoped access via the App Suite).
Core Components/Agents (DozerAI):
    Dozer Prime (Master Orchestrator): Built with LangGraph, embodying Anthropic Orchestrator-Worker model. Manages sub-agents/crews, interacts with CEO, possesses omniscient view of "The Kennel."
    Specialized Sub-Agents (e.g., "Financial Fox," "Architectural Artisan," "Market Maven," "Operational Owl," "HR Pawsitive," "Culinary Coyote," "Content Coyote"): Built with Pydantic AI. Provide domain expertise. Can form "crews" (managed by crewAI) for complex tasks.
    Pack Member Agents: Personalized instances of role-based templates, configured by Dozer Prime, providing scoped assistance via the App Suite.
UI (Dozer Employee App Suite): Unified interface for AI interaction, integrated team messenger, tasks, schedules, meeting notes, HR functions. Stunning, customizable, intuitive, with voice (ElevenLabs).
