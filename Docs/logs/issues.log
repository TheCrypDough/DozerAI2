[2025-05-26 00:15:00] - Issue Identified/Updated/Resolved (DozerAI/App): Challenges in getting the `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` script to run successfully due to a combination of environment configuration, dependency installation, database connection, and complex SQL DDL syntax for PostgreSQL. - Task: Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore - Status: Resolved - Fix: Iterative debugging and script refinement, including adjustments to `.env` handling, direct installation of `psycopg2-binary`, path corrections, and significant DDL refactoring (two-part execution with commits) to handle PostgreSQL's parsing of functions and triggers within batched statements. The final script version successfully created the entire schema.
[2025-05-26 00:15:00] - Issue Identified/Updated/Resolved (DozerAI/App): `git commit` command failing to execute correctly via `run_terminal_cmd` tool. Multiple attempts with different message formats and even without `-m` flag resulted in exit code 1 or garbled/interrupted output, preventing automated commit. - Task: Day 1 Auto-Update Workflow (Git Commit Step) - Status: Resolved - Fix: Discovered a previous commit had partially succeeded. Used `git commit --amend --no-edit` to include all staged changes, followed by a successful `git push origin main`.
