[2025-05-26 00:15:00] - Error Encountered/Resolved (DozerAI/App): Multiple errors during `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` development and execution, including: Supabase connection issues (`.env` parsing, hostname resolution `[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`), `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'` (despite `psycopg2-binary` in `requirements.txt`), incorrect `.env` file path detection, PostgreSQL syntax errors (`syntax error at end of input` for triggers in `DO $$` blocks, `function get_user_role(uuid) does not exist` during RLS policy creation). - Task: Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore - Status: Resolved - Fix: Corrected `.env` parsing, used direct `pip install psycopg2-binary`, fixed `.env` path in script, refactored SQL DDL execution into two parts with commit, schema-qualified function calls, and ensured `pgvector` was enabled. Final script `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` ran successfully.
