Milestone Completed (DozerAI/App): Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore. All sub-tasks completed. The `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` script now runs successfully, creating the full initial schema in Supabase and is idempotent. Next Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen) - Subtask: Update requirements.txt Content. Feeling: Relief that Day 1 is robustly complete, though the path was arduous. Acknowledging user frustration regarding past `git clean` incident and committing to clear logging. Date: 2025-05-26

Milestone Completed (DozerAI/App): Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen). Next Task: Awaiting Day 3 Tasks from Anthony. Feeling: Victorious! After many hurdles, the core ingestion script is working and the Kennel has its first foundational documents. The `document_title` addition was a good improvement. Date: 2025-05-27

Note (DozerAI/App): Successfully ingested "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" (97 chunks, with summaries), "DozerAI Development Chat History V1" (549 chunks, no summaries), and "Business Plan Development Chat History V1" (404 chunks, no summaries) into Supabase. Total 1050 chunks. Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP. Date: 2025-05-27

Blocker Resolved (DozerAI/App): Multiple issues with the ingestion script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`) were resolved. These included: Supabase schema mismatches (PK `document_id`, missing `full_text_content`, `chunk_sequence`, `chunk_order`), incorrect Gemini model string, `langfuse` pip version conflicts, `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL`), Gemini API `FinishReason` and safety/empty response parsing, and overly restrictive `max_output_tokens` for summaries. The Python `venv` also had to be recreated. The `chunk_order` column was deleted from Supabase. The `document_title` column was added to `document_chunks` and backfilled. Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP. Status: Resolved. Resolution: Iterative debugging and script modification. Date: 2025-05-27
