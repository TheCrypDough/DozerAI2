*(Log entries start here)*
Milestone Completed (DozerAI/App): Day 1 - Kennel Foundation: Supabase Connection, Automated Schema Execution Script, Env Config & Gitignore. All sub-tasks completed. The `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` script now runs successfully, creating the full initial schema in Supabase and is idempotent. Next Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen) - Subtask: Update requirements.txt Content. Feeling: Relief that Day 1 is robustly complete, though the path was arduous. Acknowledging user frustration regarding past `git clean` incident and committing to clear logging. Date: 2025-05-26

Milestone Completed (DozerAI/App): Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen). Next Task: Awaiting Day 3 Tasks from Anthony. Feeling: Victorious! After many hurdles, the core ingestion script is working and the Kennel has its first foundational documents. The `document_title` addition was a good improvement. Date: 2025-05-27

Note (DozerAI/App): Successfully ingested "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" (97 chunks, with summaries), "DozerAI Development Chat History V1" (549 chunks, no summaries), and "Business Plan Development Chat History V1" (404 chunks, no summaries) into Supabase. Total 1050 chunks. Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP. Date: 2025-05-27

Blocker Resolved (DozerAI/App): Multiple issues with the ingestion script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`) were resolved. These included: Supabase schema mismatches (PK `document_id`, missing `full_text_content`, `chunk_sequence`, `chunk_order`), incorrect Gemini model string, `langfuse` pip version conflicts, `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL`), Gemini API `FinishReason` and safety/empty response parsing, and overly restrictive `max_output_tokens` for summaries. The Python `venv` also had to be recreated. The `chunk_order` column was deleted from Supabase. The `document_title` column was added to `document_chunks` and backfilled. Task: Day 2 - Kennel Ingestion MVP. Status: Resolved. Resolution: Iterative debugging and script modification. Date: 2025-05-27

Milestone Completed (DozerAI/App): Day 3 - Embeddings & Basic RAG Structure. All sub-tasks completed. Successfully generated and stored 1029 embeddings using `text-embedding-004`. Created `document_embeddings` table with HNSW index and RLS. Developed `kennel_client.py`, `schemas.py`, `prime_rag_flow.py` (LangGraph), and `dozer_prime.py` (agent orchestrator). Integrated Langfuse tracing. Next Task: Awaiting Day 4 Tasks from Anthony (expected: RAG Pipeline Testing & AG-UI Introduction). Feeling: Very positive! The core RAG components are now in place, and the embedding pipeline is robust. Many tricky issues were overcome. Date: 2025-05-27

Blocker Resolved (DozerAI/App): Multiple issues with Day 3 scripts (`00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` re-run, `02_generate_and_store_embeddings.py`) and RAG components. These included: `langfuse` pip/import errors, `psycopg2` module not found (venv issue), Supabase schema errors for `document_embeddings` table and old `embedding` column, `.env` var name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL`), Google Embedding API model name prefix, dimension mismatch, and quota errors. Conceptual consistency of embedding models across RAG components was also addressed. Task: Day 3 - Embeddings & Basic RAG Structure. Status: Resolved. Resolution: Iterative debugging, schema script updates, `venv` package re-installation, Langfuse SDK usage adjustment, switch to `text-embedding-004`, and alignment of RAG components. Date: 2025-05-27

Note (DozerAI/App): Conceptual review of `kennel_client.py`, `dozer_prime.py`, and `prime_rag_flow.py` completed. Identified and applied improvements for Langfuse integration (direct kwarg passing) and embedding model consistency (`text-embedding-004`). Task: Day 3 - Embeddings & Basic RAG Structure (Final Review & Cleanup). Date: 2025-05-27
