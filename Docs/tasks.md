*   **Summary of Day's Goal:** Establish the cloud-based data infrastructure ("The Kennel") using Supabase and ensure DozerAI_Builder can programmatically set up the initial schema via an automated Python script.
*   **Issues Encountered:** Initial script connection issues with Supabase DB due to `.env` parsing and hostname resolution (IPv4/IPv6), `psycopg2-binary` not installing correctly, `.env` path issues, and PostgreSQL syntax errors with trigger and function definitions in the DDL. All resolved.

## Day 2: Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen)
*   **Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:**
    *   Update `requirements.txt` Content
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Python Script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Log Start in `rules_check.log`
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Instruct Anthony for His Tasks
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Execute Auto-Update Triggers & Workflow (as per `DozerAI_Rules_V1.md`).
        *   Status: [x] DONE (This current operation)
*   **Overall Day Status:** [x] DONE
*   **Summary of Day's Goal:** Ingest "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" and `DozerAI_Dev_Chat_History.txt` by parsing, chunking, generating contextual summaries for each chunk, and storing them in Supabase.
*   **Issues Encountered:** Multiple script errors including Supabase connection/schema mismatches (PK `document_id`, missing `full_text_content`, `chunk_sequence`, `chunk_order`), incorrect Gemini model string, `langfuse` pip install version, `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL`), Gemini API `FinishReason` parsing, and Gemini `MAX_TOKENS` too low for summaries. All resolved. `venv` also mysteriously disappeared and was recreated. `document_title` column added to `document_chunks` table and backfilled.

## Day 3 - Kennel Ingestion (Stage 2): Generating Embeddings with `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07`, HNSW Indexing & Basic RAG Logic for Dozer Prime (using `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`)
*   **Tasks for DozerAI_Builder (CursorAI):**
    *   Update `requirements.txt` Content
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Embedding Script (`02_generate_and_store_embeddings.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Initial Kennel Client (`kennel_client.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Pydantic Schemas (`schemas.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Dozer Prime Basic RAG (LangGraph - `dozer_prime.py` & `prime_rag_flow.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Integrate Langfuse Tracing
        *   Status: [x] DONE (Integrated into the developed scripts)
    *   Log Start in `rules_check.log`
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Instruct Anthony for His Tasks
        *   Status: [x] DONE
*   **Tasks for Anthony Pierce (CEO):**
    *   Update `requirements.txt`
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Install/Update Dependencies
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Save/Create Python Modules
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Ensure SQL Function for Vector Search Exists in Supabase
        *   Status: [x] DONE (This was part of Day 1 schema script)
    *   Run the Embedding Script (`02_generate_and_store_embeddings.py`)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Manually run HNSW index SQL command (if needed)
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Test Dozer Prime RAG (Optional, but recommended)
        *   Status: [x] DONE (Conceptual walkthrough completed, actual test script is for Day 4)
    *   Report to DozerAI_Builder
        *   Status: [x] DONE
*   **Overall Day Status:** [x] DONE
*   **Summary of Day\'s Goal:** Generate embeddings for all ingested document chunks using `text-embedding-004` (corrected from `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07`), store them in Supabase, create an HNSW index for efficient search, and implement a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Dozer Prime using LangGraph and `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`.
*   **Anticipated Issues:** Correct SDK usage for `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07`, batching efficiency, HNSW index creation via script vs. manual, LangGraph debugging, Langfuse integration subtleties.
*   **Actual Issues Encountered & Resolved:** Langfuse import errors (`CreateTrace`, `CreateSpan`, etc. - resolved by changing to direct kwarg passing). `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL` vs `SUPABASE_URL` - resolved). Google Embedding API model name prefix missing (`models/` - resolved). Embedding dimension mismatch (3072 vs 768 - resolved by changing to `text-embedding-004`). Google API quota exhaustion (resolved by model change and/or waiting). Conceptual issues in RAG component model name consistency (identified for Day 4 fix, applied now).
