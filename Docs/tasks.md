*   **Issues Encountered:** Initial script connection issues with Supabase DB due to `.env` parsing and hostname resolution (IPv4/IPv6), `psycopg2-binary` not installing correctly, `.env` path issues, and PostgreSQL syntax errors with trigger and function definitions in the DDL. All resolved.

## Day 2: Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen)
*   **Tasks for DozerAI_Builder:**
    *   Update `requirements.txt` Content
        *   Status: [x] DONE
    *   Develop Python Script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`)

*   **Overall Day Status:** [x] DONE
*   **Summary of Day's Goal:** Ingest "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" and `DozerAI_Dev_Chat_History.txt` by parsing, chunking, generating contextual summaries for each chunk, and storing them in Supabase.
*   **Issues Encountered:** Multiple script errors including Supabase connection/schema mismatches (PK `document_id`, missing `full_text_content`, `chunk_sequence`, `chunk_order`), incorrect Gemini model string, `langfuse` pip install version, `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL`), Gemini API `FinishReason` parsing, and Gemini `MAX_TOKENS` too low for summaries. All resolved. `venv` also mysteriously disappeared and was recreated. `document_title` column added to `document_chunks` table and backfilled.
