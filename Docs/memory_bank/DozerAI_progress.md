# DozerAI & App Suite Progress

*Last Updated: 2025-05-27 17:30:00*

## Current Project Status (End of Day 3)
Day 3 (Embeddings & Basic RAG Structure) is COMPLETED.
- All document chunks ingested on Day 2 now have corresponding embeddings (`text-embedding-004`) stored in the `document_embeddings` table in Supabase.
- An HNSW index is active on the `document_embeddings` table for efficient similarity search.
- The foundational components for a basic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline for Dozer Prime are in place:
    - `KennelClient` (`engine/core/kennel_client.py`) can perform semantic search and retrieve document chunks.
    - Pydantic schemas (`engine/core/schemas.py`) define the data structures for RAG inputs and outputs.
    - A LangGraph flow (`engine/core/langgraph_flows/prime_rag_flow.py`) defines the RAG process (embed query -> retrieve chunks -> format context -> generate response).
    - `DozerPrimeAgent` (`engine/agents/prime/dozer_prime.py`) can invoke this RAG flow.
- Langfuse tracing is integrated into the embedding script and the RAG components.
- `requirements.txt` has been updated with necessary libraries (`langgraph`, correct `langfuse` version).
- Supabase schema script (`00_initialize_supabase_schema.py`) is updated to correctly manage the `document_embeddings` table and drop the old `embedding` column from `document_chunks`.

## What Works (Verified)
- **Day 1**: Supabase schema initialization script (`00_initialize_supabase_schema.py`) creates the foundational tables (excluding `document_embeddings` initially, but now updated).
- **Day 2**: Document ingestion script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`) successfully parses, chunks, (summarizes Blueprint), and stores document data into `documents` and `document_chunks` tables.
- **Day 3**: 
    - Embedding generation script (`02_generate_and_store_embeddings.py`) successfully generates embeddings for all chunks in `document_chunks` using Google's `text-embedding-004` model and stores them in the `document_embeddings` table.
    - HNSW index on `document_embeddings.embedding` is created and active.
    - Core RAG Python modules (`kennel_client.py`, `schemas.py`, `prime_rag_flow.py`, `dozer_prime.py`) are created and are importable (basic structural integrity).
    - Langfuse tracing is integrated into these scripts and modules (calls are made, though full end-to-end Langfuse UI verification for traces is pending Day 4 RAG execution test).

## What's Left (High-Level for Next Phases)
- **Day 4 Focus**: 
    - Thoroughly test the end-to-end Dozer Prime RAG pipeline developed on Day 3 by running the `dozer_prime.py` script with sample queries.
    - Debug any runtime issues in the RAG flow or component interactions.
    - Introduce AG-UI (Agent-Generated User Interface) protocol concepts and plan for its integration.
- **Beyond Day 4 (MVP Scope & Future)**:
    - Refine RAG pipeline (e.g., advanced context formatting, re-ranking, handling of no-retrieval scenarios).
    - Develop Dozer Prime's persona and LLM prompting for generation node.
    - Implement actual FastAPI backend with an endpoint to expose Dozer Prime's RAG capabilities.
    - Begin development of the Dozer Employee App Suite frontend (React+Vite) and integrate AG-UI client logic.
    - Integrate Mem0 for agent memory and Graphiti/Neo4j for knowledge graph capabilities.
    - Develop other specialized sub-agents and crewAI collaborations.
    - Implement n8n workflows for external tool automation.
    - Comprehensive testing, security hardening, and deployment planning.
    - Ingestion of more diverse knowledge sources (tax codes, building codes, etc.).

## Known Issues & Blockers
- **Resolved (Day 3)**:
    - `langfuse` pip install version incompatibility (used `~=2.25.0`).
    - `psycopg2` import error when running schema script (installed `psycopg2-binary`).
    - Supabase schema error regarding `document_embeddings` table and old `embedding` column (updated `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py`).
    - Langfuse SDK import errors for `CreateTrace`, `CreateGeneration`, `CreateSpan` (changed to direct kwarg passing).
    - `.env` variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_API_URL` vs `SUPABASE_URL` - updated scripts).
    - Google Embedding API model name (`models/` prefix) and dimension mismatch (switched to `text-embedding-004`).
    - Google API Quota Exhaustion (mitigated by model switch).
    - Conceptual consistency for embedding models across RAG components (aligned to `text-embedding-004`).
- **Anticipated/Ongoing**:
    - Ensuring robust error handling and logging in all RAG components during Day 4 testing.
    - Potential LLM response quality issues requiring prompt engineering or RAG strategy refinement.
    - Complexity of AG-UI integration (Day 4+).
    - Standard 1-Week MVP pressure for delivering core functionality.

## What Works (Conceptual & Setup)

- **Comprehensive Vision:** Clear understanding of DozerAI agent architecture (Dozer Prime, Sub-Agents, Pack Members) and integrated Dozer Employee App Suite (Messenger, Tasks, HR, Voice).
- **Finalized Core Tech Stack:** Supabase (Postgres+`pgvector`), LangGraph, Pydantic-AI, Mem0, Graphiti/Neo4j, self-hosted n8n, Langfuse, crewAI, ElevenLabs, Google LLM (Primary).
- **RAG/CAG Strategy Defined:** Dual approach with Anthropic Contextual Retrieval for enhanced accuracy.
- **"Doing Better" Principles Adopted:** Commitment to Evaluation, Security, Cost Optimization, Scalability.
- **Project Structure & Workflow:** Detailed `project_structure.md` and operational rules (`DozerAI_Rules_V1.md`) established.
- **Git Repository:** `TheCrypDough/DozerAI2` is active.
- **Development Environment Paths:** Confirmed (`C:\Dozers\`).

All 8 schema blocks (core tables, users/roles, documents/chunks, messenger, tasks, time clock, meetings, suggestions) applied, including RLS policies. Solved various connection, dependency, and SQL syntax issues.
- **Initial Python Environment:** `venv` created, `requirements.txt` includes `psycopg[binary]`, `python-dotenv`.
- **Configuration Management:** `.env` file in `DozerAI_Code/config/` for sensitive credentials.
- **Version Control Basics:** `.gitignore` in place at `C:\Dozers\`.
- **Knowledge Ingestion Plan:** Set up for further document ingestion.

## Known Issues (Anticipated/Resolved)

- **LLM Costs & Latency:** Will require careful monitoring (Langfuse) and optimization (model choice, prompt engineering, caching).
- **Integration Complexity:** High number of sophisticated components; careful integration testing needed.
- **Data Security & Privacy:** Must be paramount in design and implementation, especially with employee data and HR features.
- **Scalability of Realtime Features:** Supabase Realtime needs to be monitored under load.
- **Self-Hosted n8n Maintenance:** Will require ongoing attention.
- **Rapid MVP Timeline (1 Week):** Risk of scope creep or feature incompletion; requires hyper-focus on core deliverables for business plan assistance.
- **Initial venv disappearance resolved:** Environment issues addressed.
