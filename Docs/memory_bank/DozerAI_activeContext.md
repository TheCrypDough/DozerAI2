# DozerAI & App Suite Active Context

*Last Updated: 2025-05-26 14:08:05*

## Current Work Focus

Transitioning to Day 2 of Phase 0: Kennel Ingestion MVP.
Task: Kennel Ingestion MVP: "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" & Our Sacred Scrolls (Dev Chat History) with Contextual Retrieval Pipeline (Stage 1: Parsing, Chunking, Context Gen).

## Recent Changes (Completion of Day 1)

- **Supabase Schema Initialized:** Successfully executed the `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` script. All tables, roles, permissions, and RLS policies for "The Kennel" and core App Suite features (Messenger, Tasks, Time Clock, Meetings, Suggestions) are created in the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
- **Python Environment Established:** `venv` created, and initial `requirements.txt` (including `psycopg[binary]`, `python-dotenv`) populated and installed.
- **`.env` Configuration:** `C:\Dozers\DozerAI_Code\config\.env` file structure established for Supabase direct DB connection details, API keys (Google, Langfuse), and other configurations.
- **`.gitignore` Created:** `C:\Dozers\.gitignore` file created and populated to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files from Git.
- **Automated Schema Script:** Developed and successfully ran `00_initialize_supabase_schema.py` using `psycopg` for direct DDL execution, ensuring robust and automated database setup.
- **Troubleshooting & Resolution:** Overcame initial challenges with Supabase connection details in `.env` (parsing, hostname resolution), `psycopg2-binary` installation, `.env` file path detection in script, and PostgreSQL syntax errors in DDL (specifically with `DO $$` blocks and function/trigger definitions). The final script executed successfully in two parts with a commit in between.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with Day 2 tasks: Develop the Python script (`01_ingest_and_contextualize_docs.py`) to parse "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0" (Markdown) and `DozerAI_Dev_Chat_History.txt` (plain text).
- Implement intelligent chunking (header-aware for Markdown, recursive character for text).
- Generate contextual summaries for each chunk using a cost-effective LLM (Google Gemini Flash).
- Store document metadata, chunks, and contextual summaries in the `documents` and `document_chunks` tables in Supabase.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Confirmed direct database connection using `psycopg` for schema initialization was successful and robust after overcoming initial hurdles.
- The two-part execution strategy for complex DDL in the schema script proved effective.
- Ready to leverage the now-established Supabase tables for Day 2's data ingestion tasks.
