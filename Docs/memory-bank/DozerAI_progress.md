# DozerAI & App Suite Progress

*Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - To be updated by DozerAI_Builder]*

## Current Status

Project Initialized. Foundational documentation (`CreationGuide`, `Rules`, log templates, `tasks.md` template, memory bank templates, `project_structure.md`) adapted and approved.
Ready to begin Day 1 of Phase 0: Supabase Project Setup & "The Kennel" Initial Schema.

## What Works (Conceptual & Planned)

- **Comprehensive Vision:** Clear understanding of DozerAI agent architecture (Dozer Prime, Sub-Agents, Pack Members) and integrated Dozer Employee App Suite (Messenger, Tasks, HR, Voice).
- **Finalized Core Tech Stack:** Supabase (Postgres+`pgvector`), LangGraph, Pydantic-AI, Mem0, Graphiti/Neo4j, self-hosted n8n, Langfuse, crewAI, ElevenLabs, Google LLM (Primary).
- **RAG/CAG Strategy Defined:** Dual approach with Anthropic Contextual Retrieval for enhanced accuracy.
- **"Doing Better" Principles Adopted:** Commitment to Evaluation, Security, Cost Optimization, Scalability.
- **Project Structure & Workflow:** Detailed `project_structure.md` and operational rules (`DozerAI_Rules_V1.md`) established.
- **Git Repository:** `TheCrypDough/DozerAI2` is active.
- **Development Environment Paths:** Confirmed (`C:\Dozers\`).

## What's Left / Not Working (All Implementation)

- **Day 1+ Implementation:** All development tasks for DozerAI and the Dozer Employee App Suite.
- **"The Kennel" Population:** Ingestion of "Dozer's Blueprint V8.0," our chat history, and other business documents.
- **Dozer Prime & Sub-Agent Development:** All agent logic, prompts, LangGraph flows, crewAI setups.
- **Mem0 & Graphiti Integration:** Actual implementation of intelligent memory and knowledge graph.
- **Dozer Employee App Suite Frontend:** Complete UI/UX development for all features.
- **Backend API Development (FastAPI):** Endpoints to support App Suite and agent interactions.
- **n8n Workflow Creation:** Building all required workflows for external tool integration.
- **Langfuse Setup & Dashboarding:** Full integration for observability.
- **ElevenLabs Integration:** Full voice I/O implementation in App Suite.
- **Testing & Evaluation:** Comprehensive test suites and performance evaluation.
- **Security Implementation:** Full RBAC via Supabase RLS and backend logic.
- **Deployment Architecture:** Design and setup for cloud deployment.

## Known Issues (Anticipated / To Monitor)

- **LLM Costs & Latency:** Will require careful monitoring (Langfuse) and optimization (model choice, prompt engineering, caching).
- **Integration Complexity:** High number of sophisticated components; careful integration testing needed.
- **Data Security & Privacy:** Must be paramount in design and implementation, especially with employee data and HR features.
- **Scalability of Realtime Features:** Supabase Realtime needs to be monitored under load.
- **Self-Hosted n8n Maintenance:** Will require ongoing attention.
- **Rapid MVP Timeline (1 Week):** Risk of scope creep or feature incompletion; requires hyper-focus on core deliverables for business plan assistance.
